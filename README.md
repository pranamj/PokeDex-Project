# Bilal's Pokedex

## Description

    Bial's Pokedex is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. 
    I built this project because I grew up watching Pokemon and thought it would be a fun idea 
    to build a basic pokedex.

## Installation

    To install, just fork and clone this repository. Once you cloned it in your terminal, 
    make sure you cd into the correct folder.

## Usage

    To get started, open index.html(for macs) or explorer.exe index.html (for windows). 
    The web app will load to a page displaying 20 random pokemon from the PokeAPI and 
    a search feature that will allow you to search for the name, type, moves and 
    weight of any pokemon. If you want these details for a pokemon among the 20, 
    simply click on the "Get Details!" button of that pokemon's card.
